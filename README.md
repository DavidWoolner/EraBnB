## Technologies

Starting with the backend, I used Ruby on Rails along with PostGresQL database and jBuilder DSL to sculpt and limit the json we send up to the frontend. On the frontend we have React to deliver the user interface and Redux to manage the state. MapBox's powerful map API was used for marking our locations, as well the as geocoding feature to create those cooridinates. The React-Calendar API, was used for our bookings interface. 

## Outstanding Features

#### UI Defined by Authentication 

Just like the real Airbnb, a user is free to roam the site and view the listings. However, in order to create a listing or booking a listing the user must log in or the they will not have access to these features throug the UI. 

### User Friendly Profile Page

From the user profile page, a logged in user can find all their listings and trips can be found side by side. From there, they can book a new trip or create a listing. 

### Dynamic Listing Page Calendar

If the listing belongs to you, you'll see all the days it is booked. Otherwise, you'll see the calendar where you can book and your trip.
